In this study, a cross-sectional survey is conducted with a sample size of 1182 students of different age groups from different educational institutions in Delhi National Capital Region (NCR). 

This project was done as a part of the course project for [Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas](https://jovian.ai/learn/data-analysis-with-python-zero-to-pandas) ,  a practical and beginner-friendly introductory course to data analysis covering the basics of Python, Numpy, Pandas, Data Visualization, and Exploratory Data Analysis.



Libraries used in this project: 
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html) : A software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/index.html) : A library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. 
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) : A plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) : A Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
